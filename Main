Creating a text-based dungeon game with multiple paths sounds like a fun project! Here’s a basic outline to get you started:

	1.	Set Up the Environment: Create a grid or map for the dungeon. Each cell represents a room or location. Decide on the size and layout of the dungeon.
	2.	Player Character: Allow the player to choose or create a character with certain attributes like strength, agility, etc.
	3.	Game Loop: Set up a loop where the player can make choices and navigate through the dungeon. Display the current location, available paths, and any obstacles or enemies.
	4.	Paths and Choices: Implement different paths and choices for the player to make. Each choice could lead to a different outcome, such as finding treasure, encountering enemies, or uncovering clues.
	5.	Obstacles and Enemies: Include obstacles like locked doors, traps, puzzles, and enemies that the player must overcome using their character’s abilities.
	6.	Items and Treasures: Scatter items and treasures throughout the dungeon for the player to collect. These could include weapons, armor, potions, keys, and other useful items.
	7.	Endings: Create multiple endings based on the player’s choices and actions throughout the game. Some endings could be more favorable than others, depending on how well the player navigates the dungeon.
